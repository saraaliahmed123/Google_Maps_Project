# Google Maps API Project

Welcome to the Google Maps API project! This project demonstrates the use of the Google Maps API to create interactive map features. The application includes seven buttons, each with different functionalities to manipulate the map.

## Features

1. **Random Marker Generator**: Clicking the first button generates a random marker on the map. Additionally, it places four extra markers 90 degrees around the original marker. Clicking on each of these extra markers generates four more markers 90 degrees from the original marker but half the distance.

2. **Geometric Shape Creator**: The second button creates a geometric shape that follows the four extra markers. When the cursor hovers over the shape, it changes color.

3. **Girlcle Drawer**: The third button finds a random location and draws a "girlcle" (geometric line shape) using the Google Maps API. It also places markers 180 degrees apart.

4. **Square Maker**: The fourth button finds a different location and draws a square with four markers on each corner and four markers inside. Clicking on the corner markers provides additional information about that location, including latitude, longitude, and other details.

5. **Shape Drawing Tool**: The fifth button allows users to draw custom shapes on the map by clicking on the map, placing markers at each point.

6. **Heatmap Layer**: Button six adds a heatmap layer to the map, displaying data heatmaps based on user input or other sources.

7. **Route Finder**: The seventh button enables users to choose two points on the map and select their preferred mode of transportation (Walking, Driving, Transit, Bicycling). After making the selection, the application provides a detailed route between the two locations.
